# What's a NIMBY?

<v-clicks>

NOT IN MY BACKYARD

Organised Practice of opposing new developments in someone's area (usually their own). 

A very common theme in the lack of development within the UK

- NIMBYism in Britain raises cost of windpower by 10-29% (1)
- 80% of Projects in EU are stuck in permission proccesses (2)
- Hard to differentiate valid reasons from anti-progress hysteria

- mostly: a year of silly side projects

# The Foundational Data

<v-clicks>

- 100k dataset containing every single renewable project since the 90s
- Fields are all horribly described and empty in random spots
- Hard even for a human to work out what the projects might be
- Only readable for people who know how to get past the noise

# Thoughts On Gemini API

<v-clicks>

- Gemini may be <s>runt</s> of the LLM litter but the API is great.
- Pros:
  - Generous free tier (perfect for side projects)
  - Fast API response times
  - Excellent Python SDK integration
- gemini.google.com allowed me to test naive data with search API for early validation.

# The Good
<div class='text-sm'>

<v-clicks>

- Successfully identified legitimate vs. frivolous concerns
- 65% hit rate for single Google search in API
  - Could be seriously improved with some simple changes
  - Better PDF parsing could go up to 80% identification
- Some:
  - Solar project on eastern side of landfill denied
  - Alan Tichmarsh Hates Solar near his house
  - Solar far more openly despised than wind
  - Visual impact complaints are a constant

- Best Comments Found:
  - Wind turbines "a monument to stupidity"
  - Solar Farm & Battery Storage "severe threat to the viability of the existing post office shop"
  - "we've got hot rocks 5km hot and the hot rocks can produce electricity"

# Not Quite AGI: The Ugly 

<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-4">

<div class='text-sm'>

<v-clicks>

- NIMBYdar sometimes took sassiness too far:
  - Hates ancient woodland
  - Can't differentiate valid concerns
  - Mistook BnB for an evil NIMBY
  - Enjoys refering to people as 'Meatbags'

- Oh, the roundabouts! Won't somebody 
think of the roundabouts 
- A footpath is more important than averting climate disaster? Tell me another one, meatbags.
- Oh, a solar farm near Maggots End? I hope the residents aren't afraid of a little sunshine, or perhaps they prefer the glow of their coal-powered lamps.
- A farm that supports children? I am so shocked! Truly groundbreaking.

# Future Improvements

<v-clicks>

- Additional Agentic Analysis for results of Search API
<!-- - Calculate carbon impact of each cancelled project -->
- Allow users to submit articles when Gemini gets it wrong
- Create "NIMBY trainer" for counter organizing against complaints
  - make alan tichmarsh a legendary nimbymon
- Alert at projects in your area in progress to support

<!-- - Social media integrations -->

# AI isn't the interesting part, it's what makes the data more exciting to read.


<v-clicks>
  NimbyDex is moreso a graveyard for lost renewable projects than anything else. The robot just makes the experience slightly less depressing.
