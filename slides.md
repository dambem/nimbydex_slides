# LLM, Agents, RAG, & MCPs 

Before we get to the funny, we gotta talk definitions. People write articles about each, here's them in single sentences.

<v-clicks>

- <b>Large Language Model (LLM)</b> - Machine learning model trained on the internet and pirated books.

- <b>Agents </b> - Giving an LLM access to tools, memory and planning, and selling it for Â£10 million

- <b>Retrieval Augmented Generation  (RAG)</b> - Giving an LLM access to correct context, so that it doesn't tell you to eat rocks.

- <b>Model Context Protocol (MCP)</b> - A protocol to let an LLM access controls in an application, so when it kills the world the process will at least be standardised.

# What's a NIMBY?

<v-clicks>

**NOT IN MY BACKYARD**

Organised practice of opposing new developments in someone's area (usually their own). 

A very common theme in the lack of development within the UK

- NIMBYism in Britain raises cost of windpower by 10-29% (1)
- 80% of Projects in EU are stuck in permission processes (2)
- Hard to differentiate valid reasons from anti-progress hysteria
- Mostly: a year of silly side projects

# The Foundational Data

<v-clicks>

- Massive dataset containing every single renewable project since the 90s
- Fields are all horribly described and empty in random spots
- Hard even for a human to work out what the projects might be
- Only readable for people who know how to get past the noise

## Other Issues
- Every Council has a different database of projects

# Thoughts On Gemini

<v-clicks>

- Gemini may be ~~runt~~ the best of LLM litter 
- Pros:
  - Generous free tier (perfect for side projects)
  - Fast API response times
  - Excellent Python SDK integration
- gemini.google.com allowed me to test naive data with search API for early validation
- Easy **MCP** & Custom Agent Integration

# The Good

<div class='text-md'>

<v-clicks>

- Successfully identified legitimate vs. frivolous concerns with correct *ground truth*

- Some findings:
  - Solar project on eastern side of landfill denied
  - Alan Tichmarsh hates solar near his house

- Best comments found:
  - Solar Farm & Battery Storage "severe threat to the viability of the existing post office shop"
  - "we've got hot rocks 5km hot and the hot rocks can produce electricity" 
    - -- Actual, Genuine Quote from a councillor.

# Model Context Protocol - Why?

<v-clicks>
The set-up for Nimbydex V1 was simple - and quickly became crazy.

- Data Changes Often, can get better sources of truth for specific renewables

- Ambigious as to what the "better" article is. 

- Some sources need to use different tools depending on structure, and i'm lazy.

- Wasted repeated searches that don't create a better result

<hr>

###  Model Context Protocol 

- Provides a structured way of interacting with Python Backend

- Seperate Agnostic Agent that provides Instructions to review and repeat

- Allows for cleaner development.

# The Shoggoth Of British Planning

<v-clicks>

But are NIMBYs actually the issue? 

At first I thought so. They're easy to blame. But then I began unravelling reading the NimbyDar.

The real enemy might be something much larger and harder to control.

- Council Websites with no easy parsing
- Systems with no shared schemas, structure or sanity
- Hundreds of documents for 150kw solar farms
- Maybe it wasn't the <b>NIMBY</b> all along?

# Future Improvements

<v-clicks>

- Continue investigating the "Planning" Shoggoth
- Allow users to submit corrections when Gemini gets it wrong
- Create "NIMBY Trainer" for local counter-organizing against complaints
- Make Alan Tichmarsh a legendary NimbyMon card (and don't get sued)
- Alert users to projects in their area in progress to support
